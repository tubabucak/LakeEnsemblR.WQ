export_all_stats(output, variable, depths, bathy_path, obs_data)

integrate_depths(
  output,
  depth,
  variable,
  bathy_path,
  obs_data = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{output}{List: A list containing model output data for different models at different depths.}

\item{variable}{character: variable name to be extracted}

\item{depths}{Numeric vector: One or more depths to extract or integrate over. But so far it just works with single vector output}

\item{bathy_path}{character: variable name to be extracted}

\item{obs_data}{list: list of observed data}

\item{depth}{numeric or vector or dataframe: 
1)if exact depth is being extracted, provide a simple numeric value,
2)if integrating across depths for all time series, provide a vector c(lower, upper)
3) if you want to integrate different depth intervals for different dates, a dataframe with datetime, lower, upper values should be given}

\item{folder}{character: main filepath; where all the output is stored}

\item{hypso_avg}{logical: if TRUE= hypsometric curve (depth-area relationship) will be used, otherwise average of 
selected columns will be calculated}

\item{dz}{numeric: interpolation depth interval. The default is 0.1}
}
\value{
A data frame of calculated statistics (e.g., RMSE, KGE) for each model, depth, and variable.

A list of integrated variables for the specified depth or depth range.
}
\description{
This function integrates a selected variable (e.g., DO, temperature) across specified depths for each model output,
compares it to observed data, and returns summary statistics.

The aim of the function is to integrate the model outputs across specified depth intervals since observed water sample data are often 
collected as integrated samples over multiple depths. 
There are two options in this function:
1)The user either specify an exact depth
2)The user give provides a depth range as a vector (e.g., `c(lower, upper)`) 
3)The user gives dataframe with dynamic lower-upper bounds for certain period. The dataframe should have columns datetime, lower, upper 
the function integrate the average values within these depts.
